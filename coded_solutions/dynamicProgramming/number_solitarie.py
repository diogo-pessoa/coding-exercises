    observations:
        - board sequential squares of 0 to n-1, a number on each square
        -  A o len N
        - some squares can be marked during the game (implications?)
        - pebble marks the square
    Goal:
        - The goal of the game is to move the pebble to the last square (N-1)
        - given a non-empty array A of N integers, returns the maximal result
        that can be achieved on the board represented by array A.
    Rules:
        - each turn is a throw of a six-side, k being the face up of the die.
        - the pebble is moved forward k+1 squares, (provided square k+1 exists)
        - k+1 not valid, throw die again, when valid move pebble to k+1(
        marking the square)
        - player score is the sum of k values of marked squares
    Boundaries:
       N is an integer within the range [2..100,000];
       each element of array A is an integer within the range [âˆ’10,000..10,000].
